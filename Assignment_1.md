## Transaction Details

> *What type of transaction did you make? What software did you use to make the transaction?*  
I made a raw transaction on bitcoin-core. Since I have Windows, I was unfortunately having some issues running transactions via scripts. Instead, I created 2 wallets on Bitcoin Core and did a transaction between them.

> *Where did you broadcast the transaction?*  
Bitcoin testnet network.
